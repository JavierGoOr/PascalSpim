# Pascal to SPIM

This project is about two things: archeology and compilers.

In 2006, I wrote a Pascal compiler for MIPS32 machines:

1) the input was a subset of Pascal language
2) the output was MIPS32 assembly (to be executed with [SPIM simulator](http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/) or [MARS](https://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/))
3) code was written in Java using JavaCC

In this repository, I am going to take my code as it was back then (without much of the quality standards I have learned along the way). My goal is to:

1) add all the tests needed
2) clean the code
3) add functionality to the compiler

Wish me luck!
